# C-Data-Structure-Visualization
This project is a web-based tool that visualizes C++ data structures such as nodes, pointers, linked lists, and doubly linked lists. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive, draggable elements so you can see pointer operations and memory addresses in action.
